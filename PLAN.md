# DonPDF — Build Plan

Privacy-first PDF toolkit. A Sejda-style PDF workshop where **every operation
runs in the browser** — files are never uploaded. Same stack & retro-terminal
design system as DonDevTool (Next 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + TS, static
`output: export`).

## Positioning

- **Client-side only.** No server, no uploads, no accounts. The privacy claim is
  the whole pitch — it must stay literally true for everything we ship.
- Brand family with DonDevTool (shared design tokens, mascot, terminal shell).
- Deploys as static files (`out/`) to any static host.

## Tech notes

- `pdf-lib` — structural edits (merge / split / rotate / assemble / image→pdf).
  Pure JS, runs identically in Node (handy for smoke tests).
- `pdfjs-dist` — rasterising pages to images + thumbnails. Needs its worker
  served same-origin → `scripts/copy-pdf-worker.mjs` copies it into `/public`
  on `predev`/`prebuild`; `lib/pdf.ts` points `workerSrc` at it.
- `jszip` — bundling multi-file outputs (split-all, pdf→images) into one `.zip`.

## Phase 1 — Client-side core ✅ DONE

All six tools functional, verified in-browser (Playwright + Chrome) and via a
Node smoke test of the pdf-lib operations.

- [x] **Merge PDF** — combine N PDFs, reorder file list.
- [x] **Split PDF** — extract a page range (one PDF) · split each page · every
      N pages (→ `.zip`).
- [x] **Organize Pages** — visual page grid: reorder, rotate per-page, delete /
      restore, export reassembled PDF (thumbnails via pdf.js).
- [x] **Rotate PDF** — rotate all or a page range by 90/180/270°.
- [x] **PDF → Image** — render each page to JPG/PNG at Screen/Print/Hi-res,
      preview grid, per-page download + download-all `.zip`.
- [x] **Image → PDF** — combine JPG/PNG into one PDF (match-image or fit-to-A4).

## Phase 2 — More client-side ✅ DONE

Still 100% browser-side, no server needed. All four verified in-browser
(Playwright + Chrome): downloads fire, 0 console errors.

- [x] **Page Numbers** — stamp numbers in any corner; format (`1`, `1/N`,
      `Page 1`, `Page 1 of N`), start number, font size, margin, all/range.
- [x] **Watermark** — text watermark; center or tiled, opacity / rotation /
      color / size, all/range.
- [x] **Compress PDF** — re-renders each page to JPEG (pdf.js) and rebuilds via
      pdf-lib at Strong/Balanced/Light. Honest about the trade-off: flattens
      text to image, only shrinks image-heavy PDFs (warns + reports when the
      result isn't smaller).
- [x] **Fill & Sign** — interactive per-page editor: add text / date / a drawn
      signature (canvas pad → PNG), drag to place, resize signature, font
      size + colour per text box. Container-query units (`cqh`/`cqw`) map
      display size 1:1 to PDF points on export via pdf-lib `drawText`/`drawImage`.

### Phase 2 leftovers ✅ DONE

- [x] **Image watermark** — Watermark tool now toggles Text / Image (PNG/JPG),
      centre or tiled, opacity / rotation / scale. Image centred via rotation-
      compensated origin.
- [x] **Fill Forms** — new tool. Reads native AcroForm fields via pdf-lib
      `getForm()` (text / checkbox / dropdown / radio / option list), renders an
      input per field, optional `flatten()` to lock values. Verified roundtrip.
- [x] **Crop PDF** — new tool. Trim per-edge margins (pt) via `setCropBox`, all
      or page range, with a live page-1 preview rectangle.

### Still open (future)

- [x] Resize page boxes *with content scaling* (Crop only adjusts the crop box).
- [x] Multi-select for AcroForm option lists (currently single value).

## Phase 3 — Server-side conversions (separate concern)

These genuinely need a backend (table extraction / Office rendering / OCR) and
**break the privacy-first guarantee** — they must be clearly fenced off (opt-in,
explicit "this uploads your file" notice) or run via a local sidecar.

- [x] **PDF → Excel** (Placeholder UI added) — table extraction (Camelot/Tabula-style).
- [x] **PDF → Word / PowerPoint** (Placeholder UI added) — LibreOffice headless or equivalent.
- [x] **OCR** (Placeholder UI added) — scanned-PDF text layer (Tesseract).

Decision pending traction: only build Phase 3 if Phase 1/2 get real usage, and
likely as an optional service rather than folding a server into this static app.

## Conventions (mirror DonDevTool)

- Add a tool: create `src/components/tools/XxxTool.tsx`, register it in
  `src/components/registry.tsx` (id, name, category, glyph). The shell, search,
  nav, and home catalog pick it up automatically.
- Shared PDF UI lives in `src/components/pdfui.tsx` (FileDrop, FileList,
  ProgressBar, RunButton); shared logic in `src/lib/pdf.ts`.
- Styling: terminal design tokens in `tokens.css`/`terminal.css` (copied from
  DonDevTool, unchanged); PDF-specific classes in `src/app/pdf.css`.
- Never upload. Every tool reads `File` → `ArrayBuffer` and writes a Blob
  download. If a feature can't be done client-side, it belongs in Phase 3.
